MINECRAFT Sign On Door
Version %VERSION%
by Tustin2121
----------------------
This program tells players attempting to connect to a minecraft server on this 
machine a message (defaulting to a 'server is off' message). This program 
cannot and is not meant to run while the minecraft server itself is running; 
it is meant to give a message to players as to why the server is not running.

Usage: java -jar MCSignOnDoor.jar [switches]
Command line switches:
	-? --help
		    Displays this message and quits
	-p --port [port]
		    Sets the port the messenger runs on (default: %PORT%)
	-i --address [ip]
		    Sets the ip address the messenger runs on (default: null)
	-m --message [message]

	   	    setting, truncated. (<=60 char max)

	-l --log [file]
		    Supplies a log file to write to (default: does not use log file)
	-s --silent
		    Does not print output to the screen
	   --sentrymode
		    When someone not banned tries to connect to the server, McSod 
		    will exit immediately with the return value 12. Useful in 
		    conjunction with a looping script.

	-c --config [file]
		    Tells McSod to read the configuration file specified. All command
		    line switches after this one will be ignored.
	   --outputconfig [filename]
		    Outputs a template config file to the specified filename. This file
		    can be edited and used with the --config command line switch.

Notes:
[1] When using special case messages (white and banned list messages), McSod 
    will attempt to load the appropriate files that the Minecraft server uses 
    to store these lists.

[2] If a blacklist message is set, it is also applied to ip-banned players, 
    unless the ip-banned players message is separately set.

[3] When setting the player ratio to show, non-numbers and a ratio with 0 max 
    players will display as "???" on the client. Player ratio also cuts into 
    the max length of the motd setting.

[4] Minecraft is backwards compatible with previous motd versions, but they are
    not forward compatible. As of MC version 1.4.2, the version is 1.

[*] Some command lines treat the bang (!) as a special command character.
    If you would like to use a bang in your server message, be sure to escape
    it with a backslash (\).
  
[*] Messages can also contain color codes by using an ampersand (&) followed 
    by a hexadecimal value (0-9 a-f). See the MC wiki's Classic Server 
    Protocol page.
